## Tips and Best Practices

### Effective AI Interactions

#### Be Specific
```bash
# Good: Specific request
AI> chat "create a function that calculates fibonacci numbers with memoization"

# Less effective: Vague request
AI> chat "help me with math"
```

#### Provide Context
```bash
# Good: With context
AI> chat "analyze the authentication system in my Flask app"

# Less effective: Without context
AI> chat "analyze authentication"
```

#### Use Follow-up Questions
```bash
AI> chat "create a user model"
AI> chat "now add validation to that model"
AI> chat "create tests for the validation"
```

### File Management Tips

#### Keep Context Focused
- Add only relevant files to context
- Clear context when switching projects
- Use specific file references

#### Use Descriptive Names
- Name files clearly
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Organize files in logical directories

### Performance Tips

#### Monitor Usage
- Check stats regularly with `stats`
- Export history periodically with `export`
- Clear context when not needed

#### Optimize Queries
- Be specific in AI requests
- Use targeted searches
- Avoid overly broad queries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### AI Not Responding
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
AI> stats
# If no AI available, you can still use file operations
```

#### Files Not Found
```bash
# Check your context
AI> context

# Add files to context
AI> chat "add main.py to context"
```

#### Slow Performance
```bash
# Check statistics
AI> stats

# Clear context if too many files
AI> clear
```

### Error Messages

#### "AI not detected"
- Install Ollama: [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
- Pull the model: `ollama pull llama2:latest`
- Restart the agent

#### "No files in context"
- Add files: `AI> chat "add my project files"`
- Check context: `AI> context`

#### "Invalid selection"
- Use valid file numbers
- Check available files with `context`
